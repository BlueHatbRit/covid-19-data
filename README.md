# Coronavirus / Covid-19 / SARS-CoV-2 Data Sets

[Italy begun publishing their daily statistics on the covid-19 pandemic in Italy](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19). The data structures are all in Italian, as an English speaker I wanted an up-to-date set of this data with English keys. This repo will update each hour with a translated set of the data.

The translated datasets are not exhaustive, I've just started with the ones I wish to use. If you want to include more country data sets, or write some code to translate some of the other Italian files then please submit a pull request.

## Data

* [`it/data/national-data.json`](./it/data/national-data.json) - The daily statistics for the outbreak for all of Italy.
